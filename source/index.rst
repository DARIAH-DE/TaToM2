Text Analysis with Topic Models for the Humanities and Social Sciences
======================================================================

*Text Analysis with Topic Models for the Humanities and Social Sciences* (TAToM)
consists of a series of tutorials covering basic procedures in quantitative text
analysis. The tutorials cover the preparation of a text corpus for analysis and
the exploration of a collection of texts using topic models and machine
learning.

These tutorials cover basic as well as somewhat advanced procedures and make
extensive use of the Python programming language to organize, analyze, and
visualize data.

These tutorials are written by `Allen Riddell <http://ariddell.org>`_.  Comments
are welcome, as are reports of bugs and typos. Please use the `project's issue
tracker <https://github.com/ariddell/tatom/issues>`_.
